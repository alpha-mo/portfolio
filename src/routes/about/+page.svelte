  <h3>Coming to Sweden</h3>
  <p>
    Escaping the war in Syria and coming to Sweden was a complex process that I
    had to go through. I had to face many challenges in order for me to adopt to
    the new life I was put up to.
  </p>
  <p>
    Being able to speak <span class="c-yellow">English</span> helped me a lot to
    learn
    <span class="c-yellow">Swedish</span> fast and start focusing on building a career
    as a developer.

    Currently studing a full-stack course with <span

    Knowing that the field requires an astonishing amount competence I had to
    teach myself many other technologies in addition to my current studies.
